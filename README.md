# Hey, I'm Josh üëã

I'm a **Full Stack Engineer** at **[Let's Do This](https://www.letsdothis.com)**, where I build event discovery and booking platforms that help people find events and races worldwide. We handle some of the biggest events in the world, including the London Marathon ballot system. Day-to-day I work with TypeScript, React, and Node.js on systems that process hundreds of thousands of registrations.

I'm passionate about building robust and scalable software, particularly with TypeScript and Go. My background in enterprise SaaS informs my approach to crafting solutions, whether it's developing AI-powered platforms or award-winning hackathon projects.

Currently diving deep into the AI landscape - building agents, experimenting with LLMs, and exploring the philosophical challenges of keeping AI systems creative as they become more intelligent. I write about the interesting problems I encounter on [my blog](https://www.joshtuddenham.tech/blog).

Before getting into engineering, I spent 10 years in fintech leading enterprise sales to hedge funds and asset managers - the kind of clients where your software either works perfectly or you don't get paid. That background means I think about what users actually need, not just what's technically interesting.

## Current Project

**[FlowAI](https://joshdesk.live)** - An agentic AI yoga instructor that creates personalized sessions and explores the creativity vs. efficiency paradox in AI systems. Maya (the AI instructor) understands traditional yoga sequences while generating custom practices based on user needs. Currently grappling with how to keep AI creative as it becomes more knowledgeable. I wrote about **[the core challenges here](https://www.joshtuddenham.tech/blog/maya-creativity-paradox)**. Built with Bun, TypeScript, React Router v7, and Google's Generative AI SDK.

## Previous Projects

**[AIgument](https://aigument.vercel.app/)** - Pit different AI models against each other in debates. You can assign personalities, control how spicy the arguments get, and save the good ones. Handles multiple LLM APIs with real-time streaming.

**[Wooster](https://github.com/joshuaisaact/Wooster)** - AI trip planner that actually helps you plan trips (React + PostgreSQL + Gemini API)

**[JoshDesk](https://joshdesk.live)** - A Slack app for hybrid work coordination. Teams across multiple companies use it to sync their office presence, check weather, and get smart reminders. Built with Bun and TypeScript, deployed on DigitalOcean.

**[Foundations](https://foundations-app.vercel.app/)** - üèÜ Won "Best in Category" at JumpStart Hackathon. A platform for job seekers to check companies' diversity stats and employee feedback. Went from idea to working product in 24 hours.

## Tools & Templates

**[Go AI Agent Foundation](https://github.com/joshuaisaact/Go-AI-Agent)** - Starting point for building AI agents in Go, includes file operations and search tools

**[Bun Server Starter](https://github.com/joshuaisaact/bun-server-starter)** - Production-ready Bun HTTP server template because I got tired of setting up the same logging and error handling
