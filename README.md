## Projects I'm Currently Working On:

### [Wooster](https://github.com/joshuaisaact/Wooster)
An AI-powered app built in React that helps users plan trips and holidays. The app uses the Gemini API to provide information about destinations and activites, and presents that to the user in an intuitive React app. The backend is built in Express, and the database is a PostgreSQL relational database built using Supabase.

### [Goss](https://github.com/joshuaisaact/Goss)
A voice-note focused social media app built in Next.js, using mobile-first design principles. The backend is built using Supabase. Group project as part of Codeworks bootcamp. I built the notifications and follow features. Here's a demo video I cut together of the app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B67vE1EfjiQ

## Smaller projects:

### [Auto Refresher](https://github.com/joshuaisaact/Auto-refresher)
A lightweight Chrome extension that continuously refreshes a tab at a user-inputted interval, only stopping when a user-entered word or phrase has been found on the page. Currently live on the Chrome web store:

### [brat quiz](https://github.com/joshuaisaact/brat-quiz)
A quiz website built in React, test your knowledge on whether certain objects or people are or are not brat.

## Past projects:

### [Atomize](https://github.com/joshuaisaact/Atomize-refactor)

A fork of Atomize, a todo app built in React. Converted the codebase to TypeScript, and refactored the entire state management approach, implementing global context and useReducer, removing 13 useEffects, 21 state variables, and fixing a number of significant bugs that were causing unintended behaviour, particularly with asynchronous state.
