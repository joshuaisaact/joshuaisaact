# Hi, I'm Josh 👋

I build software with TypeScript, Zig, Go, and Python, everything from AI-powered yoga instructors to hackathon-winning platforms.

I'm a Full Stack Engineer at [Let's Do This](https://www.letsdothis.com), where I build event discovery and booking platforms. We handle some of the biggest events in the world, including the London Marathon ballot system. I work with TypeScript, Node.js and Next.js, and on systems that process hundreds of thousands of registrations.

Right now I'm exploring everything from AI agents to low-level systems work - basically whatever seems interesting. I write about the problems I run into on [my blog](https://www.joshtuddenham.dev/blog).

Before this, I spent a decade selling enterprise software. Turns out understanding what people need is most of the battle.

## Current Project

**FlowAI** - An agentic AI yoga instructor that creates personalized sessions and explores the creativity vs. efficiency paradox in AI systems. Maya (the AI instructor) understands traditional yoga sequences while generating custom practices based on user needs. Currently grappling with how to keep AI creative as it becomes more knowledgeable. I wrote about **[the core challenges here](https://www.joshtuddenham.dev/blog/maya-creativity-paradox)**. Built with Bun, TypeScript, React Router v7, Elysia, and Google's Gen AI SDK.

## Previous Projects

**[Music Round](https://github.com/joshuaisaact/music-round)** - Real-time multiplayer song guessing game. Players identify songs from Spotify previews, with daily challenges and battle royale mode. Built with React 19, TanStack Start, and Convex for real-time sync.

**[AIgument](https://aigument.vercel.app/)** - Pit different AI models against each other in debates. You can assign personalities, control how spicy the arguments get, and save the good ones. Handles multiple LLM APIs with real-time streaming.

**[Wooster](https://github.com/joshuaisaact/Wooster)** - AI trip planner that actually helps you plan trips (React + PostgreSQL + Gemini API)

**[JoshDesk](https://joshdesk.joshtuddenham.dev/)** - A Slack app for hybrid work coordination. Teams across multiple companies use it to sync their office presence, check weather, and get smart reminders. Built with Bun and TypeScript, open source and self-hostable.

**[Foundations](https://foundations-app.vercel.app/)** - 🏆 Won "Best in Category" at JumpStart Hackathon. A platform for job seekers to check companies' diversity stats and employee feedback. Went from idea to working product in 24 hours.

## Tools & Templates

**[Go AI Agent Foundation](https://github.com/joshuaisaact/Go-AI-Agent)** - Starting point for building AI agents in Go, includes file operations and search tools

**[Bun Server Starter](https://github.com/joshuaisaact/bun-server-starter)** - Production-ready Bun HTTP server template because I got tired of setting up the same logging and error handling

**[Environment Setup](https://github.com/joshuaisaact/env-setup)** - One-script dev environment setup for Mac and Arch Linux. Dotfiles and configs so I feel at home on any machine.
