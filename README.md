# Hey, I'm Josh üëã

I'm a **Full Stack Software Engineer** at **Let's Do This**, where I build event discovery and booking platforms that help people find races and adventures worldwide. Day-to-day I work with TypeScript, React, and Node.js on systems that handle thousands of events and users.

Outside of work, I'm deep into AI development - building agents, experimenting with LLMs, and generally trying to figure out what's possible with this stuff. I write about the interesting problems I encounter on [my blog](https://www.joshtuddenham.tech/blog).

Before getting into engineering, I spent 10 years in fintech doing sales and product management. That background helps me think about what users actually need, not just what's technically interesting.

## Current Project

**[FlowAI](https://joshdesk.live)** - An agentic AI yoga instructor that creates personalized sessions and explores the creativity vs. efficiency paradox in AI systems. Maya (the AI instructor) understands traditional yoga sequences while generating custom practices based on user needs. Currently grappling with how to keep AI creative as it becomes more knowledgeable. Built with Bun, TypeScript, React Router v7, and Google's Generative AI SDK.

## Previous Projects

**[AIgument](https://aigument.vercel.app/)** - Pit different AI models against each other in debates. You can assign personalities, control how spicy the arguments get, and save the good ones. Handles multiple LLM APIs with real-time streaming.

**[Wooster](https://github.com/joshuaisaact/Wooster)** - AI trip planner that actually helps you plan trips (React + PostgreSQL + Gemini API)

**[JoshDesk](https://joshdesk.live)** - A Slack app for hybrid work coordination. Teams across multiple companies use it to sync their office presence, check weather, and get smart reminders. Built with Bun and TypeScript, deployed on DigitalOcean.

**[Foundations](https://foundations-app.vercel.app/)** - üèÜ Won "Best in Category" at JumpStart Hackathon. A platform for job seekers to check companies' diversity stats and employee feedback. Went from idea to working product in 24 hours.

## Tools & Templates

**[Go AI Agent Foundation](https://github.com/joshuaisaact/Go-AI-Agent)** - Starting point for building AI agents in Go, includes file operations and search tools

**[Bun Server Starter](https://github.com/joshuaisaact/bun-server-starter)** - Production-ready Bun HTTP server template because I got tired of setting up the same logging and error handling
